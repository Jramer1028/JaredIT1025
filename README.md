I am very sorry that I am late with this first unit, I know this is a bad first week, but I didn't read thuroughly, and I accidently skipped over the part that told me how to access my Unit 1 project. 

I love playing guitar: and swimming: and running. 

Please grade this and if you could give me points for completion that would be appreciated and I promise to do better for the rest of the class.
